# EMG

This tiny project is made for analysis electromyographic data. It can be used for any kind of sports, medicine, etc... 



## Deployment

To deploy this project you need to convert your _EMG_ to _WAV_ format.
After, you need to place your WAV files to the same directory where the algorithm is located.  
Step 1. Requirements. Yes, i am too lazy for requirements file :)
```python
  pip3 install wave argparse struct
```
Step 2. How to start.
```python
  python3 main.py [your emg wav file].wav
```
